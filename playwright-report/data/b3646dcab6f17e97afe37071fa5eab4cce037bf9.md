        - generic [ref=e68]: tions can be more urgent because of the smaller space of the
        - generic [ref=e69]: posterior fossa, consecutive brain stem compression, and
        - generic [ref=e70]: obstructive hydrocephalus. In these situations, suboccipital
        - generic [ref=e71]: decompressive craniectomy (SDC) is recommended as a life-

        - generic [ref=e84]: from preventive SDC. Determining how to select patients
        - generic [ref=e85]: who are good candidates for preventive SDC would be useful.
        - generic [ref=e86]: Thus, the purpose of this matched case–control study was to
        - generic [ref=e87]: investigate whether preventive SDC was associated with good
        - generic [ref=e88]: clinical outcome in patients with cerebellar infarction and to

        - generic [ref=e95]: radiographic data of 60 patients treated with SDC were reviewed
        - generic [ref=e96]: retrospectively in a prospectively collected database from 5 hospi-

        - generic [ref=e98]: patients with cerebrovascular diseases using similar medical and sur-
        - generic [ref=e99]: gical methods. Among them, 28 patients underwent preventive SDC

        - generic [ref=e108]: predisposing factors.
        - generic [ref=e109]: Methods
        - generic [ref=e110]: —Between March 2007 and September 2015, 28 patients underwent preventive SDC. We performed propensity
        - generic [ref=e111]: score matching to establish a proper control group among 721 patients with cerebellar infarction during the same period.
        - generic [ref=e112]: Group A (n=28) consists of those who underwent preventive SDC, and group B (n=56) consists of those who did not
        - generic [ref=e113]: undergo preventive SDC. We analyzed and compared clinical outcomes between groups.
        - generic [ref=e114]: Results
        - generic [ref=e115]: —
        - generic [ref=e116]: Clinical outcomes were better in group A than in group B at discharge (
        - generic [ref=e117]: P
        - generic [ref=e118]: =0.048) and 12-month follow-up (
        - generic [ref=e119]: P
        - generic [ref=e120]: =0.030).
        - generic [ref=e121]: Group B had more deaths within 12 months than group A (log-rank,
        - generic [ref=e122]: P
        - generic [ref=e123]: <0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that
        - generic [ref=e124]: preventive SDC (odds ratio, 4.815;
        - generic [ref=e125]: P
        - generic [ref=e126]: =0.009) and the absence of brain stem infarction (odds ratio, 2.862;
        - generic [ref=e127]: P
        - generic [ref=e128]: =0.033) were
        - generic [ref=e129]: independently associated with favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2) at 12-month follow-up.
        - generic [ref=e130]: Conclusions
        - generic [ref=e131]: —Favorable clinical outcomes including overall survival can be expected after preventive SDC in patients with a
        - generic [ref=e132]: volume ratio between 0.25 and 0.33 and the absence of brain stem infarction.
        - generic [ref=e133]: Among these patients, preventive SDC might be
        - generic [ref=e134]: better than the best medical treatment alone.
